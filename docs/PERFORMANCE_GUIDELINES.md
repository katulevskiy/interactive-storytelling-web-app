# PERFORMANCE GUIDELINES

## Introduction

This document aims to provide a comprehensive guide on user stories and API endpoints for our application. It serves as an essential resource for new developers to understand the project's full capabilities, including typical workflows and interactions between different components.

## User Stories

### Overview

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability. They help define the functions of a system based on user needs and guide development priorities.

#### Example User Story

**Title:** User Login Functionality

- **As a** registered user,
- **I want to** log in to my account using an email and password,
- **So that** I can access personalized features and content.

### Typical Workflows

1. **User Registration**
   - Navigate to the registration page.
   - Fill out the registration form with required details.
   - Submit the form to create a new user account.

2. **User Login**
   - Visit the login page.
   - Enter email and password credentials.
   - Click "Login" to access your dashboard.

3. **Profile Update**
   - Go to your profile settings.
   - Edit information such as name, email, or password.
   - Save changes to update your profile.

## API Endpoints
